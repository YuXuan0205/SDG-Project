<ol>
    <li><font size="5">We can help by reducing bullying, violence,corruption cases in our own country</li>
        <li>Donate to a charity related to Goal 16</li>
           <li>Shop local. Supporting neighbourhood businesses keeps people employed and helps prevent trucks from driving far distances</li>
              <li>When you go to a restaurant and are ordering seafood always ask: “Do you serve sustainable seafood?” Let businesses know that ocean-friendly seafood is your choice</li>
                <li>ike, walk or take public transport. Save the car trips for when you’ve got a big group</font></li>
